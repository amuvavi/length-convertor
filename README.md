# length-convertor
Distance conversion app

Following are the steps I want to follow to build this assignment

- Creating a Laravel 8 application
- Create my first test beacuse i'm going to use TDD approach
- The first thing to note is since the Web Service accepts two numbers of different units and calculate the result of the same or diffent units,
  The webservice should first convert the prescribed units to the base value, that is the unit specified as the result unit.
-After the two inputs are converted to base/ result unit, the we can add them together.
-Return a response in json format
