# length-convertor
Distance conversion app

Following are the steps I want to follow to build this assignment

- Creating a Laravel 8 application
- Create my first test because i'm going to use TDD approach
- The first thing to note is since the Web Service accepts two numbers of different units and calculate the result of the same or diffent units,
- The webservice should first convert the prescribed units to the base value, that is the unit specified as the result unit.
- After the two inputs are converted to base/ result unit, the we can add them together.
- Return a response in json format



# Things that I would like to Improve in the future.

- I'm currently using metre as a base conversion unit, I would want to use the result-unit as the basis of conversion inorder to icorporate all units of measurement as far as length is concerned.
- I would like to add my Http Response as a macro or trait so that I can use it on many classes.
- I would like to follow the Domain Driven Design, in case the application grows bigger, I will be able to modularize it.
